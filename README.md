GREngine 3D Advanced Graphical Engine.

### What is GREngine? ###

GREngine is a 3D graphical engine, built for programmers that want the best solution for your dreams, like me, but is in development.

### How do I get set up? ###

First, download and install Java3D 1.5.2 library from Oracle, and then, download GREngine in it's lastest release, and setup it as default library for your Java code. And go coding! Your GREngine development environment is totally installed!
An other specialized environment it's being developed for more general applications, but with a cost!

### How I can learn GREngine? ###

I am developing a Javadoc and a text document for learning from basics to the more advanced of the version. Please wait for!
